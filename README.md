# cc-fraud-detection-ml
This repository contains the code and documentation for my M.Tech project on credit card fraud detection. The project focuses on implementing and comparing the performance of four popular machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). 

# Project Outline
(1)Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
(2)Performance Comparison: Evaluate the efficacy of these algorithms in accurately identifying fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.
(3)Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, scale features, and encode categorical variables.
(4)Visualization: Present results and comparison metrics to demonstrate algorithm effectiveness.

# Key-features
